## The tools
### Move Layers
- Provides controls for moving selected layers horizontally or vertically by a specified distance. This utility is particularly useful for quickly adjusting layer positioning within your composition.

### Link To Null
- Facilitates linking selected layers to a newly created null object. This is beneficial for managing complex animations where multiple layers need to be controlled together.

### Add Ruler at Anchor Point
- Automatically adds guides at the anchor points of selected layers. This tool helps in precisely aligning elements within the composition without manual guide placement.

### Center Anchor Point
- Centers the anchor point of selected layers to their content. This tool is essential for properly setting rotation and scaling transformations from the desired point on a layer.

### Scale Based on Selected
- Scales selected layers based on the scale of the first selected layer. It ensures uniformity and consistency in layer sizes, which is critical in compositing and layout adjustments.

### Position Based on Selected
- Matches the position of all selected layers to that of the first selected layer. This feature is useful for quickly aligning multiple layers to a single point.

**More tools will be added.**
